      <p>There is an old-controversial ideology that money can buy happiness. </p>

      <p>In Major League Baseball, winning championships correlates with happiness. </p>  

      <p> The game of baseball has evolved a great deal over time, but the importance of superstar players and money has stayed consistent. Star players, who shine the brightest in the postseason, tend to bring in large salaries. Going back to the start of the last decade, a team with a top-12 payroll typically hoists up the Fall Classic trophy in early November.</p>

      <p>“It’s hard not to hone in on the ’15 Royals, the ’16 Cubs, ’17 Astros, and the ’21 Braves,” said Steven Pawling, an analyst for Spotrac, the largest online sports team, & player contract resource on the internet. </p>

      <p>As Pawling alluded, each team won the World Series with a payroll outside the top twelve. </p>

      <p> “There is one thing that each of those teams shares in common that the data fails to express,” Pawling exclaimed. “Each made season-altering trades that elevated their team during the regular season and in the playoffs.” </p>

      <p> In 2015, the Royals starting rotation struggled, so they went out and acquired All-Star starting pitcher Johnny Cueto. The Royals also bolstered their starting lineup by trading for veteran utility man Ben Zobrist. Both players were highly successful in the playoffs. The Royals’ middle-of-the-pack Opening Day payroll looked different when they made these two trades, as Cueto and Zobrist combined for $16.5 million in annual value that year. </p>

      <p> In 2016, star closer Aroldis Chapman was in the final year of his contract with the New York Yankees. The Yankees were looking to sell at the July deadline, and the Cubs came calling. Chapman and his $16.5 million contract came to Chicago in a blockbuster deal. Chicago also went out and traded for righty reliever Joe Smith, who was on a $5 million deal. Their contributions, especially Chapman’s, were vital in breaking the 71-year curse. </p>

      <p> The 2017 Astros saw money in a completely different light. Their 2016 Opening Day payroll was dead last in the Majors at just over $69 million. Following the ‘16-’17 offseason, hefty investments in free agency led to their payroll nearly doubling to just over $124 million, sitting 18th highest in the big leagues. At the July 31st trade deadline, they were still working on bringing in valuable assets. They traded for veteran left-hander Francisco Liriano, who was making $13 million with Toronto, and added superstar Justin Verlander, earning $28 million, in a trade with Detroit. Although the sign-stealing scandal has tainted their championship, the Verlander acquisition helped get them to the top of the mountain. </p> 

      <p> It was desperation time for the 2021 Atlanta Braves as they approached late July. After Ronald Acuña Jr. suffered a season-ending injury, they needed to reconstruct their outfield, and General Manager Alex Anthopoulos did just that. They pulled off four trades for outfielders Jorge Soler, Eddie Rosario, Joc Pederson, and Adam Duvall. The four netted a $25.5 million payroll increase, but it was well worth it. The Braves completely turned things around in the second half and coasted into the playoffs. In the postseason, Rosario won the National League Championship Series Most Valuable Player, and Soler won the World Series Most Valuable Player, as the Braves brought home their fourth world championship. </p>

      <p> As Pawling expressed, the Opening Day payroll data is skewed with how each championship team’s payroll was ranked on Opening Day. Each team’s in-season transactions paid great dividends with the season’s end result but added heavily upon their previous Opening Day payroll. </p>

     <iframe title="&quot;Low-Spending&quot; World Series Champions with their Opening Day Payroll and Adjusted Payroll" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-9AdTS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9AdTS/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="420" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
     </script>

     <p> If one were to re-rank the adjusted payroll for each team within the Opening Day payrolls, there would be a drastic change: </p>
     <ul>
     <li> The 2015 Kansas City Royals would have had the <b> 10th </b> highest payroll (previously 16th).
     <li> The 2016 Chicago Cubs would have had the <b> ninth </b> highest payroll (previously 14th).
     <li> The 2017 Houston Astros would have had the <b> 10th </b> highest payroll (previously 18th).
     <li> The 2021 Atlanta Braves would have had the <b> 10th </b> highest payroll (previously 13th).
     </ul>

     <p> Even if it may look like the four teams had a more challenging track to the World Series because they invested “less” money, through some in-season analysis, they are just like the rest of them. </p>

     <p> Steven Pawling understands the importance of a top payroll in Major League Baseball, but he sees a potential shift in how organizations build up their payrolls in the future. </p>

     <p> “The Atlanta Braves have revolutionized how teams negotiate with their players,” Pawling said. “They have put great trust in their scouting department and analytics team, and it has paid off.” </p>

     <p> The Braves have had a much different approach to building their future. Instead of making their young players prove themselves at the Major League level for a substantial period, they offer them long, affordable and enticing contracts. Sure, many risks are involved, but making significant investments in scouting and analytics departments, lowers the risk. </p>

     <p> So how did the Braves do it? </p>
     <ul>
     <li> In April 2019, they signed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. to an eight-year, $100 million contract ($12.5 million in average annual value). </li>
     <li> Days later, on April 11th, they signed second baseman Ozzie Albies to a seven-year, $35 million contract with two additional club option years ($5 million in average annual value). </li>
     <li> In August of 2022, they agreed to an eight-year, $72 million contract (and an additional two club option years) with outfielder Michael Harris ($9 million in average annual value).</li>
     <li> In October of 2022, they reached an agreement with starting pitcher Spencer Strider on a six-year, $75 million with an additional club option year ($12.5 million in average annual value). </li>
     </ul>

      <p> Each of these players is now under team control until at least 2026. This allows Atlanta to make more significant moves in free agency to build around their young and affordable superstars. Acuña Jr., Albies, Harris and Strider are all worth upwards of $25-35 million in annual value on the open market. Atlanta has been able to “beat” them to the open market, in other words, before they are free agents, so that they can make many more valuable commitments. </p>

      <p> Within the last year and a half, the Braves have reached agreements with two star players on lengthy contracts. Last offseason, they extended first baseman Matt Olson, who they had just acquired in a trade, to an eight-year, $168 million contract. In August of this year, they made the most lucrative deal in franchise history, extending third baseman Austin Riley to a 10-year, $212 million deal. Each player will be making just over $21 million annually during the extent of their contracts. </p>

      <p> “Even when they make large investments, it still somehow trails their actual market value,” Pawling said. “The Olson and Riley extensions have set them up with two superstar players for a long time. It’s truly remarkable what the Braves have been able to do.” </p>

      <p> Yes, the Braves will have one of the heftiest payrolls in baseball for years to come. Still, how they allocate their money to their talented young players and proven superstars makes them more flexible than any other team in Major League Baseball. </p>

      <p> Money can indeed buy happiness in Major League Baseball, and the Atlanta Braves have created a new model for teams to follow to facilitate bringing home World Series championships. </p>
